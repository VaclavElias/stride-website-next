# Stride Website - Next

Just playing with different design ideas and possibilities.

The motivation for the update is:

- [x] to simplify design
- [x] use Bootstrap 5.2
  - this was also used previously with lots of inconsistency
- [x] use Fontawesome 6
  - this was also used previously
- [ ] remove old unnecessary code, AddThis, Discus, JQuery, JavaScript libraries
- [x] get better website responsivness
- [ ] keep the content as it is and where it is, maybe just improve if needed

## Phase 1
