# Stride Website - Next

Just playing with different design ideas and possibilities.

The motivation for the update is:

- to simplify design
- use Bootstrap 5.2
  - this was also used previously with lots of inconsistency
- use Fontawesome 6
  - this was also used previously
- remove old unnecessary code, AddThis, Discus, JQuery, JavaScript libraries
- get better website responsivness
- keep the content as it is and where it is, maybe just improve if needed

## What is done

- [x] Top Navigation
  - [ ] Search button
- [x] Home Page
  - [ ] Content and images update?
- [x] Features Page
  - [ ] Content and images update?
  - [ ] Maybe add section dedicated to scripting, mentioning ```async```, maybe add code snippets?
