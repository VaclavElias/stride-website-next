# Stride Website - Next

Just playing with different design ideas and possibilities.

The goal is:

- to simplify design
- use Bootstrap 5.2, customise for Stride (colours)
- remove old unnecessary code, AddThis
- get better website responsivness
- keep the content as it is and where it is, maybe just improve if needed

## Initial work

- Move Home Page
- Move Blog and some posts
- Move Features Page
