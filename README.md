## Getting Started

All the information you need to get started with Stride Website development can be found in the [Stride Website Wiki](https://github.com/VaclavElias/stride-website-next/wiki).

## Contributing

Use [Discord](https://discord.gg/f6aerfE) for questions and general discussions. 
Use [Issues](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-website/issues) to report bugs and proposing features.

We welcome code contributions through pull requests. Issues tagged as **[`help-wanted`](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-website/labels/help-wanted)** are good candidates for starting to contribute code.

### Branch and Release

The `master` branch is the default branch for pull requests and most other development activities. 

Releases are based on a stable `master` branch. Use of [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is encouraged.

Stride Website is _not_ released under a regular cadence; new updates arrive when maintainers fix issues or see enough changes that warrant a new releases. Sometimes we use prereleases to get feedbacks from the community.

## Roadmap

Our Wiki [Roadmap](https://github.com/VaclavElias/stride-website-next/wiki/Roadmap) communicates upcoming changes to the Stride website.
