## The Motivation for the Update

The Stride website has been around for some time âŒ›. It was originally created using Jekyll. Over the years, we have added more content, but the website has not been updated for quite a while.

Our main goal was to make the website future-proof and easy to maintain. We also wanted to improve the overall user experience and give it a more modern feel.

- Improved consistency across pages, posts, and styling, offering an excellent readability experience
- Enhanced content readability
- Modern and simplified design
- Updated static page generator: Eleventy 2.0 (previously Jekyll)
- Bootstrap 5.3 (previously Bootstrap 3)
- Font Awesome 6 (previuosly 4.4)
- Removal of old, unnecessary code, such as AddThis, Disqus, JQuery, and JavaScript libraries
- Improved website responsiveness (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Content review and minor corrections
- [Tags](/tags/) page
- [Archive](/archive/) page
- Every singnle page was reviewed and updated ðŸ¤¯
- Dark Theme (Experimental)
- Search functionality now includes our [documentation]({{ site.links.docs-url }}) website

This new update will enable us to share more content with you faster and more easily. We will also be able to add more features and enhance the overall experience.

## What's next

We will continue to improve the website and add more content. We will also be adding more features and further refining the overall experience.
