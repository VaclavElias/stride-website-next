<p>Everyone in the Xenko team have been working hard to bring you the new features and tools. We are proud to announce that Xenko 1.1.0β version is now available for download.</p>

<p>
<img src="/images/blog/release-1.1/robot_editor.jpg"/>
</p>

<p>Here are the new features on the new and updated version:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Physically Based Rendering</b> with Layered Material System</li>
<li>A brand <b>new scene editor</b> that is now the central piece of Xenko to assemble your game levels, test the rendering, script your entities.</li>
<li><b>Scene rendering compositor</b>, offering a new way to define precisely how to render scenes in your game, apply post effects...etc.</li>
<li>Easy-to-use and powerful <b>post-effects API</b> coming along many built-in effects (Depth Of Field, Bloom, Lens Flare, Glare, ToneMapping, Vignetting, Film Grain, Antialiasing...)</li>
<li>New implementation of <b>Shadow Mapping</b>, supporting SDSM (Sample Distribution Shadow Maps with adaptive depth splits)</li>
<li><b>Scripting System</b>, to easily add behavior and data to entities</li>
<li>In Visual Studio, when you edit .pdxsl shaders, there is now <b>Error Highlighting</b> and <b>F12 (Go to Definition)</b> to make shader editing as smooth as possible.</li>
<li>A <b>new launcher</b>, that can manage several versions of Xenko SDK side-by-side</li>
</ul>

<p>We have been working to get as many mobile platforms to be included in this release but not all are fully supported yet. Some samples may not work yet so we ask for your patience. The whole team is hard at work to make sure that everything will work on the next update.</p>

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Android: Android projects should be compiled against Android API v5.0 (only a compile-time requirement, runtime requirement is still Android 2.3+)</li>
<li>Assets: The entity asset has been removed, entities should be created inside a scene.</li>
<li>General: Previous Xenko 1.0.x projects cannot be loaded in this new version</li>
<li>Engine: Deferred lighting was removed. We will later add support for Forward+ and Deferred GBuffer shading</li>
<li>Engine: <code>ScriptSystem.Add</code> has been renamed <code>ScriptSystem.AddTask</code>. <code>Add</code> is now used only to add scripts</li>
<li>Engine: Sprites of <code>SpriteComponents</code> are now rendered in 3D. Their size is defined by the scale of the entity</li>
<li>Engine: UI should be configured via entities and <code>UIComponents</code> and not via the <code>UISystem</code> anymore</li>
<li>Engine: <code>VirtualResolution</code> has been removed from <code>Game</code> and should now be set directly in the <code>UIComponent</code></li>
<li>Engine: Direction of Oz axis have been inversed in the UI to have an RH space</li>
<li>Graphics: ParameterCollection are now grouped together in a ParameterCollectionGroup at creation time. This object can then be used in Effect.Apply().</li>
<li>Physics: Collider Shape Asset and Physics Component have been simplified, their asset version is now not compatible with the old version.</li>
<li>Physics: Debug shape rendering has been replaced by editor gizmos.</li>
<li>Shaders: Previous generated code for <code>pdxfx</code> is broken and must be regenerated</li>
<li>Studio: Changed naming conventions of imported assets.</li>
<li>Studio: The studio and asset compilation process are now running only on 64bits machines</li>
</ul>

<h4>Known Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>Platforms: Shaders can’t compile due to lack of a proper workflow on other platforms than Windows Desktop  (this will be fixed soon)</li>
<li>Platforms: Android and iOS platforms are currently not properly supported (this will be fixed soon).</li>
<li>Platforms: iOS x64 is not yet supported (this will be added soon)</li>
<li>Assets: Reimporting a Model asset (i.e. FBX) might have issues when merging materials</li>
<li>Assets: ModelAsset scaling and orientation works only for .FBX, not other formats supported by Assimp library</li>
<li>Studio: Scripts are not automatically reloaded by the editor. Closing and re-opening it is needed in order to see new scripts.</li>
<li>Studio: Renaming default scene won’t properly update reference. Please set again the reference in project properties.</li>
<li>Studio: DDS images cannot be viewed in the Sprite editor</li>
<li>Studio: Collections in assets properties cannot be edited nor displayed in multi-selection</li>
</ul>
