<h1>Roadmap</h1>
We just published our roadmap online:

<a href="https://trello.com/b/FwbjOjjB" target="_blank" class="readon">View Roadmap</a>

We are excited to share our future plan and work with the community.

You will be able to see the short term (few months) future plans relatively precisely, and some longer terms plans we have. The tag colors indicate progress on each features. 

Our release cycle is once every 2 to 3 months, and we will try to include as many new features as we every time. Of course we will also release patches when faster fixes are needed.

We will keep updating the Trello roadmap on a regular basis an constantly tune it.

We are passionate about building this engine and prioritize features that makes it a great tool to make games.

Thus hearing the voices of our community is important. Please vote on the features and participate to our survey below!
