We have continued to work hard on our support in Xenko for Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Keeping with this, we've been working closely with our Microsoft partners to add official support for the Xbox Live SDK. So, now Xenko developers will have the opportunity to add Xbox live to their games. 

**What is the Xbox Live SDK?**

The Xbox Live SDK is a set of APIs that power all social interactions on Xbox Live including friends, achievements, and multiplayer. Started originally on XBox, the service is now available on multiple other platforms.

It is available on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/XboxLive) for registered ID@Xbox developers.

If you haven't yet joined ID@Xbox you can learn about the program and how to join [here](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/developers/id).

Once you have applied to the program and have been accepted as a managed partner with Microsoft, feel free to get started using our newly created Xbox Live sample [here](http://doc.stride3d.net/latest/manual/platforms/uwp/xbox-live.html).
