Now that [Xenko 3.1 beta is well underway](2018-12-24-release-xenko-3-1-0-beta.md), it's time to prepare for the future.

As part of this process, I would like to involve our newly formed community.

The idea is to decide together during a developer meeting what are the next long-term targets for Xenko, and what to put in release 3.2+.

The first developer meeting will be open to everybody (developers, users and potential future users).  
It's possible we then evolve toward a more moderated format if needed.

Here is a [tentative schedule](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Xenko+Developer+Meeting+%231&iso=20190123T01&p1=248&ah=1) for this meeting: 

* **Tokyo (Japan)** Wednesday, 23 January 2019, 01:00:00	JST
* **Berlin (Germany)** Tuesday, 22 January 2019, 17:00:00	CET

* **New York (USA - New York)** Tuesday, 22 January 2019, 11:00:00	EST
* **UTC (GMT)** Tuesday, 22 January 2019, 16:00:00

It will be held on [Discord](https://discord.gg/f6aerfE) in the #dev-meetings channel.

Please come define the future of Xenko with us!
