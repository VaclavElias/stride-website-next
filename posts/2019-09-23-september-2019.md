Hi everyone,

Welcome to the September blog post of Xenko. In this blog, we will have a quick recap on what's going on with Xenko development and its community. From now on we will have a monthly recap blog to let the world know what we are up to. 

##Picking up speed
Since the last developer meeting in July, it was made clear that Xenko really needs the help of the community to improve. Part of improving is making sure that the community can help out on various aspects of Xenko. This is not just the development of the Xenko engine itself, but also all the other processes that are involved around it. You can follow the ongoing forum discussion [here](https://forums.stride3d.net/t/community-call-for-help/1997).

##New project overview
As part of getting things done quicker, a new public project overview has been set up using Freedcamp. In this here we track of ongoing tasks, who is assigned to it and what possible milestones are. If you want to contribute to this project or just check out the current tasks, have a [look](https://freedcamp.com/Xenko_YO2/XenkoManagementT_3sf/todos).

##What is being worked on 
Here are some of the things that are being worked on:

* New tutorials section for the [documentation](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/index.html) website. Starting with a section of C# basics with Xenko, we can start making it easier for people to get the hang of Xenko in no time. Here is a quick [peek](https://forums.stride3d.net/t/improving-the-api-documentation/1961/18) at how it is going to look like.
* Phr00t fork merging: The [Phr00t fork](https://github.com/phr00t/xenko) contains many features that the main Xenko engine could benefit from. From countless API improvements to bigger features like Vulkan improvements. Right now contributors are looking in which features and functionality to move to the main Xenko repository.

##Possible name change
For those of you who have missed it: Xenko is looking for a possible rename of the engine. If you want to know more about the why and why not, have a look at this [forum topic](https://forums.stride3d.net/t/xenko-help-us-find-a-new-name-logo-for-the-engine-if-we-have-to-rename/1980). Regardless of whether the name change will happen, we need to find a suitable candidate. In a few weeks, we will start a poll to narrow down the long list of suggested names. A more detailed blog on this will follow soon. In the meantime, if you have a great idea, feel free to make a suggestion in the topic above or in the Xenko discord channel “Name-change”.
