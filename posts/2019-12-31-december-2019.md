Happy new year everybody. In this blog we do a quick recap of the final developments of Xenko in 2019 and what the community has been up to.

---

## What is being worked on? 
* The latest new features are being finished for the release of 3.2. This version should be released near the end of January.

## Community Meeting 3
On December 18th we held another community meeting. Check [here](https://stride3d.net/blog/community-meeting-3/) for the summary. The most important thing here is that we are getting ready for the rename.

## Stride Logo
With 'Stride' being the new name for Xenko in the near future, the #logo-change Discord channel has been seeing a lot of suggestions and even a voting on some of the ideas from the community.

## Community Picks
Check out these awesome projects that community members have been working on:

### Testing Xenko by MentalArray

Testing the Xenko game engine took only a week to do this that included learning the scripting system and all model building and texturing was really trying to figure out animations and happy with result
