## Current Funding

With a budget of **$4,220.48 USD** at the moment of the community meeting happening, we wanted to decide on whether to allocate money for bugs and new features. So a big thanks to all those who are donating to this project. In particular:

* [VVVV](https://visualprogramming.net/)
* [Va≈°o (vaclav)](https://opencollective.com/vaclav)
* [ORE system](https://www.ore-system.com/) with a diamond sponsorship

## Funding for bug bounties
* Fullscreen Vulkan support
    * [Github ticket](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues/455)
    * Bounty: $200,- USD
    * AggrorJorn will provide the texts for the bounty and once approved by other contributors/developers in the team, this will be updated on the Open Collective project for [Bug bounties](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects/bug-bounties).
* UI slowness bug
    * [Github ticket](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues/455)
    * A smaller $50,- USD bounty for more research on this bug. If it can be pinpointed what exactly is causing this, we can also estimate better whether it is worth spending more money on it.
    * Depending on the outcome we might skip this bug and spend time researching/implementing a replacement UI.
    * AggrorJorn will provide the texts for the bounty and once approved by other contributors/developers in the team, this will be updated on the Open Collective project for [Bug bounties](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects/bug-bounties)

## Funding for features
