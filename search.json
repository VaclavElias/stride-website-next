    "content":"Stride contributors are proud to announce a new release now running on .NET 6 supporting the latest C# 10. That means you can now head to the download page and start developing your games using the latest .NET technologies.Stride On .NET Live Improvements Summary Improvement Details Known Issues A Little Help Stride On .NET Live ðŸ”—We had the pleasure to be on a live stream with the .NET team! We gave an introduction, overview and some live demos: Improvements Summary ðŸ”—Here's a non-exhaustive list of new improvements:.NET 6 support and VS 2022 pluginStride 4.1 leverages the power of .NET 6Support for C# 10Dithered shadows for semi-transparent materialsPhysics constraintsBullet constraints wrapped around in easy to use functionalityEditor gizmos for physics constraintsPhysics performance optimizationACES tonemapingFog image effectOutline image effectImproved editor gizmosC# Intermediate tutorials projectThis Open Collective sub-project was successfully funded by the community. All related video recordings are available on Stride's Youtube channel and the tutorials page in the documentation will also be update to reflect the new project.Many more minor fixes and quality of life improvementsFixed sample gameSimpler Procedural Model creationNew math signatures (1122, 1121, 1090)Dispatcher/threadpool improvementsAmbient Occlusion quality improvementAnd many other fixesImprovement Details ðŸ”—Dithered shadows for semi-transparent materials ðŸ”—Produces semi-transparent shadows by poking more and more holes in the shadow map based on the transparency of the object, shadow map filtering will blur those holes with their neighbor which will result in those partially opaque pixels.Physics constraints ðŸ”—Stride's physics system Bullet comes with a set of constraints for you to use in your projects. These constraints are now all visible inside the editor, previewing the constraints using various editor gizmo.For more information on all the types of constraints, you can read up about them in the Stride documentation or watch the video below.Physics optimizations ðŸ”—Retrieving collision and contact information was previously done by re-testing all components for collisions, which, as one might expect, led to awful performance for physics heavy scenes (could take up to and above 90% of the frame).Contacts are now lazily evaluated to reduce overhead when nothing ends up reading them. Users can now read and iterate over all collisions through Simulation.CurrentCollisions.Improved editor gizmos ðŸ”—The old gizmos weren't very nice to look at, so this feature makes them look better and more user-friendly. It also changes how the rotation gizmo works and adds scale planes to the scale gizmo.This feature also updates the text on the CameraOrientationGizmo to be XYZ instead of right/left. Still prefer the old text instead of the XYZ coordinate? Don't worry, there's a setting under the viewport settings that swaps it back to the old text.Intermediate tutorials ðŸ”—One of the first Open Collective sub-projects is the intermediate C# tutorials project. After discussion in community meetings and with various contributors donating directly to this project, the amount for this project to be included in Stride quickly became a realization.With Stride 4.1, you will be able to select the C# intermediate tutorials project as a new template project. The template project contains (at the moment of writing) 11 topics that every developer will want to have a look at.UI basicsCollision triggersRaycastingProjecting and UnprojectingAsync(hronous) scriptsScene loadingAnimation basicsAudioFirst person cameraThird person cameraNavigationEach tutorial has a video tutorial accompanying it, which can be found on Stride's Youtube channel. Below you can find the full playlist. Known Issues ðŸ”—Integrated C# Editor ðŸ”—The transition to .NET6 unfortunately broke the help tooltips and the code completion of the integrated C# code editor. But we decided to accept it for now, as everyone is using a proper C# editor anyways, such as Visual Studio, Rider or Visual Studio Code.The reason for the error is that RoslynPad, the underlaying library, also needs an update or fix. We'll adress this in one of the upcoming minor version releases.A Little Help ðŸ”—We, contributors, believe that Stride can help .NET game developers make the games they want with ease using their favorite languages. We want to make sure Stride offers the most comfortable environment for developing games, and this takes time and effort.Since the free and open-source release of Stride, the community has been growing slowly, so we have decided to open a fund to reward developers for any contribution they make to Stride. We set up an Open Collective page to manage our funds and allocate money for features that the community would like to see implemented.We have various bounties for bug fixes and features (Vulkan support, decals, morph targets, and many others). If you have or know someone with the skills to tackle those bounties, please reach out to us through the respective Github tickets. You can also contact us through our discord server or on Github to propose new bounties.Contributors ðŸ”—Many thanks to all the contributors who have donated their time and skill by adding features, fixing bugs, managing the build pipelines, adding documentation, and reviewing PRs.Financial contributors ðŸ”—Also, a huge thanks to the individuals and companies who contributed financially to our Open Collective!ORE System with a diamond sponsorshipxen2 Core contributor that donated a large portion of the previous Patreon back through Open collectivevvvv A visual live-programming environment for easy prototyping and development.

    "content":"Summary Community Meeting 2022 ðŸ”—Hello there fellow Striders,On February 16th we held another community meeting. A whopping 2.5 hours with various subjects. Here is a quick summary.Summary Community Meeting 2022 Current Funding Funding for bug bounties Funding for features Release 4.1 Additional task for Xen2 Work in progress Epic grant Current Funding ðŸ”—With a budget of $4,220.48 USD at the moment of the community meeting happening, we wanted to decide on whether to allocate money for bugs and new features. So a big thanks to all those who are donating to this project. In particular:VVVVVaÅ¡o (vaclav)ORE system with a diamond sponsorshipFunding for bug bounties ðŸ”—Fullscreen Vulkan supportGithub ticketBounty: $200,- USDAggrorJorn will provide the texts for the bounty and once approved by other contributors/developers in the team, this will be updated on the Open Collective project for Bug bounties.UI slowness bugGithub ticketA smaller $50,- USD bounty for more research on this bug. If it can be pinpointed what exactly is causing this, we can also estimate better whether it is worth spending more money on it.Depending on the outcome we might skip this bug and spend time researching/implementing a replacement UI.AggrorJorn will provide the texts for the bounty and once approved by other contributors/developers in the team, this will be updated on the Open Collective project for Bug bountiesFunding for features ðŸ”—Linux runtime supportGithub ticketRequires mores fleshed out details and deliverablesOnce that is done, we can decide on fundingEither fixed amount or use xx,xx amount per hour with a certain limit.New Open collective project Linux runtimeDecal supportGithub discussion requires more deliverablesNew Open collective project Decals added and will be updated once deliverables are clear:]Morphing target animation support[Github discussion] (https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues/339)requires more deliverablesNew Open collective project Morhping Target added and will be updated once deliverables are clear:Embed stride into UI frameworksThere already is a work in progress PR that allows developers to specify a custom render context.New Open collective Project for Embedding Stride into UI frameworksSilk.NETNew Open collective project Silk.NETRelease 4.1 ðŸ”—Release notes wip are prepared by Eideren/Vaso/Yka.Final checks by Xen2: VS pluginAdditional task for Xen2 ðŸ”—Documentation needs to auto-release when Release branch is updatedAsk previous implementer of SPIR-V shader system if he is interested in new work for StrideWork in progress ðŸ”—Code only project: will enter beta phaseWhen merged into Stride 4.2 beta, we will add an Open collective page for additional examples.C# Pong game example: finishing touches (sound)The following C# intermediate tutorials are written but not yet recorded:UI basicsBoth via the editor as well as entirely through codeScene loadingLoading/UnloadingReloading scenesChild scenesCollision triggersRaycastingAnimation basicsAudioSmall tutorial reallyNavigation meshes and pathfindingBoth editor as well as code only approachesSync vs AsyncDifference and 2 examplesEpic grant ðŸ”—Yka and AggrorJorn have a look at Epic grant and make final proposal in the 3rd week of February"
