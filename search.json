    "content":"Stride contributors are proud to announce a new release now running on .NET 6 supporting the latest C# 10. That means you can now head to the download page and start developing your games using the latest .NET technologies.Stride On .NET Live Improvements Summary Improvement Details Known Issues A Little Help Stride On .NET Live ðŸ”—We had the pleasure to be on a live stream with the .NET team! We gave an introduction, overview and some live demos: Improvements Summary ðŸ”—Here's a non-exhaustive list of new improvements:.NET 6 support and VS 2022 pluginStride 4.1 leverages the power of .NET 6Support for C# 10Dithered shadows for semi-transparent materialsPhysics constraintsBullet constraints wrapped around in easy to use functionalityEditor gizmos for physics constraintsPhysics performance optimizationACES tonemapingFog image effectOutline image effectImproved editor gizmosC# Intermediate tutorials projectThis Open Collective sub-project was successfully funded by the community. All related video recordings are available on Stride's Youtube channel and the tutorials page in the documentation will also be update to reflect the new project.Many more minor fixes and quality of life improvementsFixed sample gameSimpler Procedural Model creationNew math signatures (1122, 1121, 1090)Dispatcher/threadpool improvementsAmbient Occlusion quality improvementAnd many other fixesImprovement Details ðŸ”—Dithered shadows for semi-transparent materials ðŸ”—Produces semi-transparent shadows by poking more and more holes in the shadow map based on the transparency of the object, shadow map filtering will blur those holes with their neighbor which will result in those partially opaque pixels.Physics constraints ðŸ”—Stride's physics system Bullet comes with a set of constraints for you to use in your projects. These constraints are now all visible inside the editor, previewing the constraints using various editor gizmo.For more information on all the types of constraints, you can read up about them in the Stride documentation or watch the video below.Physics optimizations ðŸ”—Retrieving collision and contact information was previously done by re-testing all components for collisions, which, as one might expect, led to awful performance for physics heavy scenes (could take up to and above 90% of the frame).Contacts are now lazily evaluated to reduce overhead when nothing ends up reading them. Users can now read and iterate over all collisions through Simulation.CurrentCollisions.Improved editor gizmos ðŸ”—The old gizmos weren't very nice to look at, so this feature makes them look better and more user-friendly. It also changes how the rotation gizmo works and adds scale planes to the scale gizmo.This feature also updates the text on the CameraOrientationGizmo to be XYZ instead of right/left. Still prefer the old text instead of the XYZ coordinate? Don't worry, there's a setting under the viewport settings that swaps it back to the old text.Intermediate tutorials ðŸ”—One of the first Open Collective sub-projects is the intermediate C# tutorials project. After discussion in community meetings and with various contributors donating directly to this project, the amount for this project to be included in Stride quickly became a realization.With Stride 4.1, you will be able to select the C# intermediate tutorials project as a new template project. The template project contains (at the moment of writing) 11 topics that every developer will want to have a look at.UI basicsCollision triggersRaycastingProjecting and UnprojectingAsync(hronous) scriptsScene loadingAnimation basicsAudioFirst person cameraThird person cameraNavigationEach tutorial has a video tutorial accompanying it, which can be found on Stride's Youtube channel. Below you can find the full playlist. Known Issues ðŸ”—Integrated C# Editor ðŸ”—The transition to .NET6 unfortunately broke the help tooltips and the code completion of the integrated C# code editor. But we decided to accept it for now, as everyone is using a proper C# editor anyways, such as Visual Studio, Rider or Visual Studio Code.The reason for the error is that RoslynPad, the underlaying library, also needs an update or fix. We'll adress this in one of the upcoming minor version releases.A Little Help ðŸ”—We, contributors, believe that Stride can help .NET game developers make the games they want with ease using their favorite languages. We want to make sure Stride offers the most comfortable environment for developing games, and this takes time and effort.Since the free and open-source release of Stride, the community has been growing slowly, so we have decided to open a fund to reward developers for any contribution they make to Stride. We set up an Open Collective page to manage our funds and allocate money for features that the community would like to see implemented.We have various bounties for bug fixes and features (Vulkan support, decals, morph targets, and many others). If you have or know someone with the skills to tackle those bounties, please reach out to us through the respective Github tickets. You can also contact us through our discord server or on Github to propose new bounties.Contributors ðŸ”—Many thanks to all the contributors who have donated their time and skill by adding features, fixing bugs, managing the build pipelines, adding documentation, and reviewing PRs.Financial contributors ðŸ”—Also, a huge thanks to the individuals and companies who contributed financially to our Open Collective!ORE System with a diamond sponsorshipxen2 Core contributor that donated a large portion of the previous Patreon back through Open collectivevvvv A visual live-programming environment for easy prototyping and development.

Funding proposals include fullscreen Vulkan support, UI slowness bug research, Linux runtime support, decal support, morphing target animation support, and embedding Stride into UI frameworks.

Ongoing development includes physics constraints, splines, and the upcoming release of version 4.1.Summary ðŸ”—November 29th we had another commmunity meeting. This blog post summarizes the topics we talked about.Summary Sponsors A Month of Open Collective Preparing Request Epic Grant Other Action Items Ongoing Development Sponsors ðŸ”—Started of with a thank you to all those who donated on the new sponsor platform: Open collective. In particular a big thanks to:Xen2, who decided that he wanted to contribute some of the Patreon money back in to the community.ORE systemðŸ’ŽVVVVðŸ¥‡VaÅ¡o (Vaclav)ðŸ¥‡A Month of Open Collective ðŸ”—After a month using the new sponsor platform, the Stride collective has reached a balance of $1,984.31 USD. We started discussing how and where the money should be distributed to. We want to do this with the help of Open collective 'Projects'. These projects are listed on Stride's Open collective page, and have their own tiers, targets and description. Users can sponsor projects directly instead of the main Stride collective if they want to.We have come up with several projects that need to be written out in more detail before we will add them to the Open collective page. All tickets below have a Github disscusion for more details.OC project: Bug bounties projectBefore starting on an issue, make it known on Github and Discord that your are willing to tackle the issue. It would be a shame if multiple people try to solve the same issue.Any PR to the Stride repo must be reviewed by a contributor and discussed if needed.Once a PR is reviewed and merged to the Stride repo, the submitter 60% of the bounty.The submitter receives the remaining 40% when stride release happens.Github DiscussionOC project: .NET 6 platforms supportIn order for proper support for macOs, we need hardware to test this on. Xen2 will look in to the hardware requirements for this.Github DiscussionOC project: Shader systemXen2 will gather info and budget requirementsGithub DiscussionOC project: Linux/macOS support'A rather large topic that require a lot of work is the the support for Linux and/or macOs. When worked out in more detail, it can be used in the plan for requesting an Epic grant. Subtopics to resolve:Runtime/3dBuild tools (able to msbuild a Stride project and have the asset compiler work on it) requirement: FBX/AssimpEditorGithub DiscussionPreparing Request Epic Grant ðŸ”—For a while now we have been wanting to pursue the option of requesting an Epig grant. In order to do so however, we need to come up with a proper plan. The endgoal is to have a proper document explaining what we want to do, and how we plan to spend any given budget.AggrorJorn starts a github ticket where we gather info on the request to Epic. He will contact others for proof read and further info. Github DiscussionSome of the topics mentioned:Shader systemEditor rewriteMegascan IntegrationECS rewrite/Run Update() and Render() in parallelOther Action Items ðŸ”—We close forum in December as there is almost no activity there. We want to utilize Discord and Github discussion for this. The forum will be read only but we will no longer refer to it from the website and Github.Use a Github project for remaining tasks: OverviewGithub ticket on a simple free community marketplaceGithub DiscussionA lot of people have made usefull components/utilities/art and other usefull assets for in Stride projects. Right now we don't have a quick and easy to import such assets in to an existing (editor) project.What we can do it is utilise the existing Nuget (tagging) system so that users can quickly add a component to their ongoing project in the editor.Documentation on the stride source/new comers tutorialYKA, Manio143 and Tebjan collect some info for a tutorial: Github DiscussionOngoing Development ðŸ”—Manio143: finishing touches/documentation for Physics constraintsAggrorJorn: SplinesTrying to finish the base splines which could be integrated in to the Stride source. Other Spline based components should be added later, so that we can have a milestone finished.Some tricky stuff with custom translation gizmo's for controlling tangents in the editor are currently holding me back. If this isn't resolved quickly I will make a PR without this (nice to have) featureRelease of 4.1 only held back by final .NET 6 related fixes. After that Xen2 will prepare release. AggrorJorn will aid in blogpost release notes"
