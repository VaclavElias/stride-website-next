    "content":"Stride contributors are proud to announce a new release now running on .NET 6 supporting the latest C# 10. That means you can now head to the download page and start developing your games using the latest .NET technologies.Stride On .NET Live Improvements Summary Improvement Details Known Issues A Little Help Stride On .NET Live ðŸ”—We had the pleasure to be on a live stream with the .NET team! We gave an introduction, overview and some live demos: Improvements Summary ðŸ”—Here's a non-exhaustive list of new improvements:.NET 6 support and VS 2022 pluginStride 4.1 leverages the power of .NET 6Support for C# 10Dithered shadows for semi-transparent materialsPhysics constraintsBullet constraints wrapped around in easy to use functionalityEditor gizmos for physics constraintsPhysics performance optimizationACES tonemapingFog image effectOutline image effectImproved editor gizmosC# Intermediate tutorials projectThis Open Collective sub-project was successfully funded by the community. All related video recordings are available on Stride's Youtube channel and the tutorials page in the documentation will also be update to reflect the new project.Many more minor fixes and quality of life improvementsFixed sample gameSimpler Procedural Model creationNew math signatures (1122, 1121, 1090)Dispatcher/threadpool improvementsAmbient Occlusion quality improvementAnd many other fixesImprovement Details ðŸ”—Dithered shadows for semi-transparent materials ðŸ”—Produces semi-transparent shadows by poking more and more holes in the shadow map based on the transparency of the object, shadow map filtering will blur those holes with their neighbor which will result in those partially opaque pixels.Physics constraints ðŸ”—Stride's physics system Bullet comes with a set of constraints for you to use in your projects. These constraints are now all visible inside the editor, previewing the constraints using various editor gizmo.For more information on all the types of constraints, you can read up about them in the Stride documentation or watch the video below.Physics optimizations ðŸ”—Retrieving collision and contact information was previously done by re-testing all components for collisions, which, as one might expect, led to awful performance for physics heavy scenes (could take up to and above 90% of the frame).Contacts are now lazily evaluated to reduce overhead when nothing ends up reading them. Users can now read and iterate over all collisions through Simulation.CurrentCollisions.Improved editor gizmos ðŸ”—The old gizmos weren't very nice to look at, so this feature makes them look better and more user-friendly. It also changes how the rotation gizmo works and adds scale planes to the scale gizmo.This feature also updates the text on the CameraOrientationGizmo to be XYZ instead of right/left. Still prefer the old text instead of the XYZ coordinate? Don't worry, there's a setting under the viewport settings that swaps it back to the old text.Intermediate tutorials ðŸ”—One of the first Open Collective sub-projects is the intermediate C# tutorials project. After discussion in community meetings and with various contributors donating directly to this project, the amount for this project to be included in Stride quickly became a realization.With Stride 4.1, you will be able to select the C# intermediate tutorials project as a new template project. The template project contains (at the moment of writing) 11 topics that every developer will want to have a look at.UI basicsCollision triggersRaycastingProjecting and UnprojectingAsync(hronous) scriptsScene loadingAnimation basicsAudioFirst person cameraThird person cameraNavigationEach tutorial has a video tutorial accompanying it, which can be found on Stride's Youtube channel. Below you can find the full playlist. Known Issues ðŸ”—Integrated C# Editor ðŸ”—The transition to .NET6 unfortunately broke the help tooltips and the code completion of the integrated C# code editor. But we decided to accept it for now, as everyone is using a proper C# editor anyways, such as Visual Studio, Rider or Visual Studio Code.The reason for the error is that RoslynPad, the underlaying library, also needs an update or fix. We'll adress this in one of the upcoming minor version releases.A Little Help ðŸ”—We, contributors, believe that Stride can help .NET game developers make the games they want with ease using their favorite languages. We want to make sure Stride offers the most comfortable environment for developing games, and this takes time and effort.Since the free and open-source release of Stride, the community has been growing slowly, so we have decided to open a fund to reward developers for any contribution they make to Stride. We set up an Open Collective page to manage our funds and allocate money for features that the community would like to see implemented.We have various bounties for bug fixes and features (Vulkan support, decals, morph targets, and many others). If you have or know someone with the skills to tackle those bounties, please reach out to us through the respective Github tickets. You can also contact us through our discord server or on Github to propose new bounties.Contributors ðŸ”—Many thanks to all the contributors who have donated their time and skill by adding features, fixing bugs, managing the build pipelines, adding documentation, and reviewing PRs.Financial contributors ðŸ”—Also, a huge thanks to the individuals and companies who contributed financially to our Open Collective!ORE System with a diamond sponsorshipxen2 Core contributor that donated a large portion of the previous Patreon back through Open collectivevvvv A visual live-programming environment for easy prototyping and development.

Ongoing development includes physics constraints, splines, and the upcoming release of version 4.1.Summary ðŸ”—November 29th we had another commmunity meeting. This blog post summarizes the topics we talked about.Summary Sponsors A Month of Open Collective Preparing Request Epic Grant Other Action Items Ongoing Development Sponsors ðŸ”—Started of with a thank you to all those who donated on the new sponsor platform: Open collective. In particular a big thanks to:Xen2, who decided that he wanted to contribute some of the Patreon money back in to the community.ORE systemðŸ’ŽVVVVðŸ¥‡VaÅ¡o ( Vaclav )ðŸ¥‡A Month of Open Collective ðŸ”—After a month using the new sponsor platform, the Stride collective has reached a balance of $1,984.31 USD. We started discussing how and where the money should be distributed to. We want to do this with the help of Open collective 'Projects'. These projects are listed on Stride's Open collective page, and have their own tiers, targets and description. Users can sponsor projects directly instead of the main Stride collective if they want to.We have come up with several projects that need to be written out in more detail before we will add them to the Open collective page. All tickets below have a Github disscusion for more details.OC project: Bug bounties projectBefore starting on an issue, make it known on Github and Discord that your are willing to tackle the issue. It would be a shame if multiple people try to solve the same issue.Any PR to the Stride repo must be reviewed by a contributor and discussed if needed.Once a PR is reviewed and merged to the Stride repo, the submitter 60% of the bounty.The submitter receives the remaining 40% when stride release happens.Github DiscussionOC project: .NET 6 platforms supportIn order for proper support for macOs, we need hardware to test this on. Xen2 will look in to the hardware requirements for this.Github DiscussionOC project: Shader systemXen2 will gather info and budget requirementsGithub DiscussionOC project: Linux/macOS support'A rather large topic that require a lot of work is the the support for Linux and/or macOs. When worked out in more detail, it can be used in the plan for requesting an Epic grant. Subtopics to resolve:Runtime/3dBuild tools (able to msbuild a Stride project and have the asset compiler work on it) requirement: FBX/AssimpEditorGithub DiscussionPreparing Request Epic Grant ðŸ”—For a while now we have been wanting to pursue the option of requesting an Epig grant. In order to do so however, we need to come up with a proper plan. The endgoal is to have a proper document explaining what we want to do, and how we plan to spend any given budget.AggrorJorn starts a github ticket where we gather info on the request to Epic. He will contact others for proof read and further info. Github DiscussionSome of the topics mentioned:Shader systemEditor rewriteMegascan IntegrationECS rewrite/Run Update() and Render() in parallelOther Action Items ðŸ”—We close forum in December as there is almost no activity there. We want to utilize Discord and Github discussion for this. The forum will be read only but we will no longer refer to it from the website and Github.Use a Github project for remaining tasks: OverviewGithub ticket on a simple free community marketplaceGithub DiscussionA lot of people have made usefull components/utilities/art and other usefull assets for in Stride projects. Right now we don't have a quick and easy to import such assets in to an existing (editor) project.What we can do it is utilise the existing Nuget (tagging) system so that users can quickly add a component to their ongoing project in the editor.Documentation on the stride source/new comers tutorialYKA, Manio143 and Tebjan collect some info for a tutorial: Github DiscussionOngoing Development ðŸ”—Manio143: finishing touches/documentation for Physics constraintsAggrorJorn: SplinesTrying to finish the base splines which could be integrated in to the Stride source. Other Spline based components should be added later, so that we can have a milestone finished.Some tricky stuff with custom translation gizmo's for controlling tangents in the editor are currently holding me back. If this isn't resolved quickly I will make a PR without this (nice to have) featureRelease of 4.1 only held back by final .NET 6 related fixes. After that Xen2 will prepare release.

    "content":"Stride has been using Patreon and Github sponsors for a while now. However, in the recent community meeting of october 1st it became apparent that these donation platforms don't really suit all of our needs. Both Github sponsors and Patreon don't really show where the money is going.To solve this we have been looking at a different platform that allows us to communicate more openly on our expenses and where money will be spent. After some investigation and various registration and other formalities, we can now say goodbye to Patreon, as Stride will from now use the Open Collective platform.Summary ðŸ”—Summary Open (Source) Collective Payments and Expenses Projects What's Next? Open (Source) Collective ðŸ”—Open collective is similar to other sponsor platforms, but sticks out in the way it openly displays payments and expenses. Everything about it is open for everyone to see. Through various Tiers, people can sponsor the Stride game engine. Each tier will have its own reward(s). Some tiers for instance will have the reward that users are shown on the stride website as a thank you. This is being worked on.We also needed a good way to deal with payments towards contributors and any tax related activities that come with it. Open collective allows the Stride collective to join a so-called 'Fiscal host' which takes care of all of that for us, for a percentage of the money contributed. After some communication and verification on the Stride github repository we are now also officially connected with the Open Source Collective. The Open Source Collective has various open source projects under its wing: WebPack, VueJs, OBS, Babel, Bootstrap and many more.Payments and Expenses ðŸ”—Every payment made to a contributor will always show up on the Stride's open collective. A Stride contributor can submit an invoice: for instance the cost of Google accounts or domain names. These invoices can be approved by the Stride contributors team. These are the same people that are active members of the Stride Contributors team on Github. Submitted invoices can be approved at any given time but allocating money for specific projects is done at the end of each month (or beginning).Projects ðŸ”—The Stride contributors have the final call where all the collected money will be allocated too. This will be done with the help of Projects. This Open Collective feature acts as a sort of 'Ledger' where money can be stored until the time comes to pay the contributor(s) of a project. A project can have its own tiers and goals. Those projects could be all sorts of things: new engine features, research on new technology, high priority bugs or documentation. These kinds of projects will be discussed at community meetings to get the input of the Stride community. Here is an example project.People can also choose to donate to a specific project rather than the Stride collective in general if they want to. So if you only want to see your money being used for a specific cause, you are completely free to do so. You are more than welcome to do both of course. In the image below you can see an example of how money that has been donated to the Stride collective, has been partially allocated to a specific project.What's Next? ðŸ”—We first want to see how this first month of the new platform goes. At the end of November/beginning December we will hold a new community meeting and we will discuss how things went and how we plan on distributing the donations.There are also some remaining tasks regarding the Open Collective that will be taken care of in the weeks to come:Setup webhook to DiscordSetup webhook to TwitterFully automate the website to show sponsorsFully automate the Github backers.md file with sponsorsWrite up blog on the entire process on how we spend moneyAdd open collective to sponsors.yaml on github"

    "content":"It has been quite a while since we had a community meeting with the Stride community. On the 1st of October 2021 we had a good 2 hour chat about various topics on the Stride game engine.Summary ðŸ”—Summary Access Rights Roadmap Funding Stride 4.1 Remaining Topics Access Rights ðŸ”—First topic was about clearing up access rights of the Stride source contributors and how this can be displayed better to the rest of the world.Github features a teams option, which is now free for open source projects. Xen2 made sure that those contributing to the engine are now part of the team on Github: https://github.com/orgs/stride3d/teams/stride-contributors. These contributors can review and approve pull requests in to the various stride projects (engine, website, documentation).When changes are merged into the website project and specifically the 'release' branch, an automated process will trigger the website deployment.Documentation is updated as well, although this is a manual process that needs to be triggered. Xen2 and Aggror will do some knowledge sharing in private, so that this process does not lie solely with xen2.Social media accessYoutube: xen2 and AggrorFacebook: xen2 and M0THTwitter: xen2 and AggrorRoadmap ðŸ”—The roadmap on Github hasn't received an update in quite a while. The reason for this is that there simply is no capacity to pick up these kind of features like terrain editor, visual programming etc.What we see in the community is that various contributors work on useful features for their own games, and as a result these kind of features and bug fixes and up being merged in to the Stride repository.As a result it has now been decided that we no longer will use the roadmap on Github. At the moment of writing this blog, the roadmap has already been removed. If, in the future, we have more funding and capacity, we can re-introduce it again.Aggror will try to put out a blogpost once a month keeping the community up to date on features that community members are working on. This also requires some initiative from the community. So if you have something that you are working on, feel free to send a message to Aggror on Discord. That we can feature your screenshots, videos, PR's in a blogpost on the stride website.Funding ðŸ”—There were 2 ways to contribute to Stride financially: Patreon and Xen2 sponsorship on his Github account.Both these donation services didnâ€™t really give a clear overview where the money was being spent on.Sponsoring Xen2 on Github would specifically and only go to Xen2. On top of that there is no easy way to use this as a marketing tool.Only Xen2 had access to Patreon, making it another responsibility for him to:Post something interesting on Patreon (for which he has no time)Do tax related activities and payments.Because of the above, Stride's Patreon page will soon close (or already might be at the time of posting blog)Aggror will look into setting up a more open way of viewing where money from donations is being spent on. The idea here is to have a look at Open CollectiveAggror will present his findings to xen2. Once a decision has been made, the community will be informed..NET foundationStride has joined the .NET foundation. The .NET foundation offers to host various services on their Azure subscriptions. That means that a majority of the costs when it comes to hosting is taken care of for us.As a result of this, Xen will move various services from Digital ocean to Azure. This will reduce costs. Money that is gained from donations can be spent on bug bounties, features and documentation. Once we have a new donation mechanism in place, we will have another community meeting on how to distribute money.Aggror will also be included in the communication with .Net foundation.Xen2 gave a nice summary on the operating costs for various (web related)servicesAzure: used to be $50~$100 per month but now paid by .NET FoundationStackPath (CDN): $10 per month, can be moved to AzureGoogle Cloud Service: $5 per monthDigitalOcean: $30 per month (teamcity and forums server), can be moved to AzureGitHub: $40 per monthSome demo's use LFS. If .NET foundation were to cover those costs too, we could add additional demo's.SSL: used to be expensive but now free (auto renew let's encrypt or Azure)Domains: cheap, $10 per yearApplying for a grant with Epic, Microsoft etc.Although this is something that we want to pursue, we first want to have a new donation service in place. The next community meeting will cover this topic again.Stride 4.1 ðŸ”—Stride 4.1 is on its way, but when exactly and what can we expect this year?Stride 4.1 BETA will include the upgrade to .NET 6Stride 4.1 targeted around november/december 2021Although full Linux support is not possible right now, we will look at having the Linux runtime working again with Stride 4.1Aggror will start collect info for the release notesRemaining Topics ðŸ”—For the remaining topics, we ran out of time, so these will be picked up at another community meeting."

Voxel Cone Tracing GI .NET 5 Flexible GPU Instancing Graphics API: Different Selection Mechanism + Vulkan Improvements Documentation &amp; Tutorials New Developers are Welcome! Xenko is now Stride! ðŸ”—The Xenko game engine has been renamed to Stride. From now on, all source code, blogs, and tutorials will use the name â€˜Strideâ€™ instead of â€˜Xenkoâ€™.Here is the new logo:More details available on the dedicated blog post.Voxel Cone Tracing GI ðŸ”—Thanks to a substantial contribution from Sean Boettger and sponsored by David Jeske, Stride now supports Voxel Cone Tracing GI!Here it is in action:As you can see, there are many customizations and settings available in the editor:There's a documentation page explaining how to set up the project with Voxel Cone Tracing GI.Here's the original forum post and pull request. Thanks again for this great contribution!.NET 5 ðŸ”—Stride editor and toolchain is now running with .NET 5! Runtime has been working with .NET Core for a few versions already.This allows us to have scripts and custom assets in a project targetting .NET Standard 2.1 or .NET 5.If you have scripts or custom assets in a .NET Framework project rather than a .NET Standard project, you can still choose between .NET 5 and .NET Framework within the launcher:The framework will also be displayed in the Game Studio toolbar for easier identification while both coexist..NET Framework version can be considered deprecated and will likely be removed in a future release (likely 4.1) to allow us to take full advantage of C# 8.0 and soon-to-come C# 9.0.We also expect dropping .NET Framework and supporting only .NET 5 will greatly simplify our installation process since we won't depend on specific workloads or packages of Visual Studio being installed anymore. This was a recurring issue with our users.Flexible GPU Instancing ðŸ”—Aka geometry instancing. Thanks to another big community contribution sponsored by vvvv, Stride now supports GPU instancing per model.The nice thing about it is, that it plays together with the entity-component system: Simply add an Instancing component to an entity with a model. Then you can choose between 3 ways of how you generate the instances:EntityTransform, uses the transformation of other entities with an Instance component. This allows you to add components like physics, audio, etc. to each instance.UserArray, for providing an array of matrices via scriptUserBuffer, for providing a structured buffer (GPU resource) of matrices via scriptUserArray and UserBuffer even allow you to specify how the matrix is multiplied with the parent transformation.It even works with skinning:Picking individual instances in Game Studio works as well and selects the entity with the respective Instance component.There are also two new entity templates for easy setup:An example project that shows the new features can be found here: StrideTransformationInstancingGraphics API: Different Selection Mechanism + Vulkan Improvements ðŸ”—There's been a big overhaul on Stride build system to make Graphics API selection work in a more future-proof way.It was previously relying on the custom RuntimeIdentifier being set in the solution. This didn't work very well because it was completely orthogonal to the existing RuntimeIdentifier, and sometimes not having good fallbacks.From now on, the user project will use StrideGraphicsApi in the .csproj project file to specify the graphics API. We hope to expose this in the editor later.We also took the opportunity to improve the state of Vulkan renderer (thanks to a switch to Vortice.Vulkan bindings from Amer Koleci) and automatize graphics unit tests, currently running for D3D11 and Vulkan.It's still a work in progress so expect more in future releases.Documentation &amp; Tutorials ðŸ”—The first 10 C# beginner tutorials are recorded and uploaded to the official Stride Youtube channel. You check out the playlist here.These videos are the video equivalent of the existing online documentation for the C# beginner template tutorials and the 'new project' template when creating a new project from the Stride launcher.The C# beginner series should be fully recorded by the end of July 2020.After those videos are done, Jorn will put his focus on the C# Intermediate project template. Here a is work in progress screenshot on the raycasting tutorial:New Developers are Welcome! ðŸ”—The Stride GitHub repository has more closed pull requests than open issues. This is a good sign! But in order to move faster and adapt to new technologies, we would be very happy to see more new talents in our friendly and professional developer community.There are several good reasons to join us:Writing engine code in C# is fun and quite productiveStride users will work with what you createWe are happy to help, should you get stuckYou can learn a lot, the Stride code base is very professional and has high-quality standardsAn open-source contribution is a great addition to your portfolioNo matter whether you (or someone you know) can contribute documentation updates, UI improvements, bug fixes, or new rendering technologies, we welcome everyone!"
